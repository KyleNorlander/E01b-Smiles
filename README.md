# E01b-Smiles
By changing the x and y coordinates in each corresponding line I was able to move the smiley from the bottom left of the screen, to the middle of the screen. In main4.py when you edit lines 16-18 is all of the smileys move together in sync, with the last coordinate changing the overall frequency of smileys (less or more). Also, I attempted to explain main5.py and its lines. I feel like I understood it for the most part and am excited to see the results.
